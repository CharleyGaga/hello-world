Introduction to GitHub
My name is Karen Steel, but I also go by the nickname Charley (cos I was obsessed with Charlie's Angels) and Gaga because I adore Lady Gaga. I'm trying to learn more about coding because I really enjoy it and I'd like to move into more of a software direction. I currently work for a local council as digital manager within the comms team and rebuilt their website.
